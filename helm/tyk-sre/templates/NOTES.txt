The tyk-sre-assignment application has been deployed.

1. To check the deployed pods:

   kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. To check the service:

   kubectl get svc {{ .Release.Name }}-service -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

3. To access the application locally (port-forward):

   kubectl port-forward svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-service 8080:8080 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Then open another terminal and run:

   curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health/apiserver
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health/deployments

These commands allow you to verify the application’s readiness and API server connectivity from your local environment.
